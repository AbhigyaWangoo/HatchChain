However, the job description specifically emphasizes proficiency in Next.js, TypeScript, and Prisma, and it is not explicitly mentioned whether the candidate has experience working with Prisma.

Considering the required years of experience and the specific focus on Next.js, TypeScript, and Prisma in the job description, I would recommend rejecting the candidate based on the information provided. However, if there is additional information or context that suggests the candidate's strong potential in these areas, further evaluation may be warranted."

Considering the job description's requirement for 3 years of experience and the lack of clear information about Yash's experience duration in the relevant positions, it is uncertain if Yash meets the experience requirement. Therefore, it is difficult to definitively accept or reject the candidate for the provided job. If the 5-month experience at Champaign Urbana Business and Engineering Consulting and the ongoing Founding Engineer role at RedRock Financial, LLC, are considered equivalent to 3 years of professional experience, then Yash could be considered for the position.

Preeti has also worked as a Software Engineer Intern at UnitedHealth Group, where she developed and executed a successful Angular upgrade for the web portal. This experience demonstrates her proficiency in frontend development.

However, the job description requires a minimum of 3 years of professional experience, and Preeti's resume indicates only 1 year of experience. If the company is open to hiring candidates with less experience, Preeti would be a strong candidate based on her skills and impact in her previous roles. If the company strictly adheres to the 3-year experience requirement, Preeti may not be the best fit for this position."

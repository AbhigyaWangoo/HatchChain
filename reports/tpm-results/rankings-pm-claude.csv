Ankur Dahiya,www.linkedin.com/in/ankurdahiya______github.com/run-x/opta,"Based on the information provided, I would reject Ankur Dahiya for the Technical Product Manager position. Here is my reasoning:

Ankur has very strong software engineering experience, having worked as an engineer, senior engineer, staff engineer, engineering manager, and director of engineering at several top tech companies like Facebook, Twitter, Flexport, and Rippling. However, the job posting is looking for a Technical Product Manager with a minimum of 3 years of project management experience. While Ankur has clearly demonstrated technical skills, there is no evidence he has experience actually managing products or projects. The job also requires expertise in Agile methodologies, project management tools, streaming technologies, and cloud services, but Ankur's background is primarily in software development languages and frameworks like Python, Scala, PHP, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails. 

So while Ankur has an impressive engineering background, he does not seem to match the project management and product focus that the Technical Product Manager role requires. There is a mismatch between his skills/experience and what the job is looking for. I would therefore reject his application and continue searching for candidates with specific project management and streaming service/cloud expertise. However, Ankur would likely be an excellent candidate for a Director of Engineering or other senior software engineering role."
Navan Kothari,https://www.linkedin.com/in/navan-kothari/,"Based on the information provided, I would reject Navan Kothari as a candidate for the Technical Product Manager position. Here is my assessment:

Navan is currently a student set to graduate in 2026. The job posting requires a minimum of 3 years of project management experience. As a current student, it is unlikely Navan meets this requirement.

The job posting specifies needing experience with Agile methodologies, AWS, Azure, Python, and managing technical requirements. Navan's resume does not mention any of these required qualifications. His experience is in business, information technology management, and computing - not specialized technical project management.

While Navan may develop some of these technical skills in the future, at this time there is not enough evidence that he matches the qualifications listed in the job description. His current background seems more business/operations focused rather than hands-on technical project management.

In summary, I would reject Navan's application because he does not meet the minimum years of experience required, nor does he demonstrate the specific technical skills in AWS, Azure, Python, Agile methodologies that the Technical Product Manager role demands. I don't have enough signal that he would be a good fit."

- He has some professional experience in technical roles like Python Grader and Sales Associate, demonstrating competence.

Negatives: 
- The job requires a minimum of 3 years of project management experience with a focus on enhancing a cutting-edge streaming service. Harshil does not have any clear project management experience based on his resume. His roles have been more focused on programming, grading, and sales rather than leading projects.
- The job requires knowledge of project management tools, streaming technologies, and cloud services like AWS/Azure. Harshil's resume does not mention knowledge or experience in these areas. 
- While communication skills are listed as important in the job description, his resume does not provide evidence for assessing communication abilities.

In summary, while Harshil seems technically competent, he does not fulfill the minimum project management experience required or demonstrate knowledge of the specific tools and technologies listed for this Technical Product Manager role. Since the job description explicitly states a 3 year minimum experience requirement in the field, I would have to reject his application based on the information provided. However, his skills could likely qualify him for other more technical roles."
Keerthi Priya Chekuri,linkedin.com,"Based on the information provided, I would reject Keerthi Priya Chekuri for the Technical Product Manager position. The main reasons are:

1. The job description requires a minimum of 3 years of project management experience, but Keerthi only has experience as an intern for a few months. She does not meet the minimum experience requirement.

2. The role involves managing project lifecycles using Agile methodologies, but there is no evidence that Keerthi has experience with Agile or project management methodologies based on her resume. 

3. The job requires technical skills in project management tools, streaming technologies, and cloud services, but Keerthi's resume mostly highlights analytics skills in tools like R, SQL, and Tableau. There is no clear match with the required technical skills.

1) Kaiwen does not have the required 3 years of project management experience. As a student graduating in 2025, they likely have 0 years of professional experience. The job posting specifically asks for someone with at least 3 years of experience managing projects and overseeing project lifecycles.

2) While Kaiwen seems to have strong technical skills in areas like C++, Python, JavaScript, etc., there is no evidence they have experience with project management methodologies like Agile. The job posting asks for someone with a strong Agile background.

3) There are no details provided about Kaiwen's communication, problem-solving, or leadership abilities. The job posting mentions that excellent communication skills, problem-solving abilities, and leadership qualities are essential. 

4) Kaiwen's experience is primarily in web development, open source contributions, and an internship focused on web accessibility. The Technical Product Manager role requires knowledge of streaming technologies and coordinating features specifically for a streaming platform. Kaiwen's background does not seem directly relevant.

In summary, while Kaiwen has impressive coding abilities and technical skills, they do not meet the minimum required years of experience in project management. There are also gaps between Kaiwen's background and the specific responsibilities and qualifications called out for this Technical Product Manager position. I would reject their application and continue searching for candidates who are a closer match."
Artem Tkachuk,www.linkedin.com/in/artemtkachuk,"Based on the information provided, I would reject Artem as a candidate for this Technical Product Manager role. The main reasons are:

1) The job posting requires a minimum of 3 years of project management experience, but Artem's resume does not show any direct project management experience. His background is primarily in computer science and mathematics.

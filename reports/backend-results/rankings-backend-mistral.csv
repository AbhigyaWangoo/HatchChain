Gauri Pidatala,www.linkedin.com/in/gauripidatala,"Based on the information provided, I would reject the candidate Gauri Pidatala for the Software Engineer position focused on payments infrastructure. The reasons for this decision are as follows:

1. Lack of experience: The candidate has no full-time experience as a Backend Engineer, which is a crucial requirement for this position. Although they have relevant internships, the minimum requirement for this job is 3 years of experience as a Backend Engineer, which the candidate does not meet.
2. Fintech or payments industry experience: The job description emphasizes the need for experience in the fintech or payments industry. However, the candidate does not have any experience in this field, which might be a disadvantage.
3. Skills and proficiency: Although the candidate has experience with some of the required programming languages (Java, Python) and frameworks (Django), they do not have proficiency in Go, which is explicitly mentioned in the job description. Additionally, they lack experience with message queues and event-driven architectures (RabbitMQ or Kafka), containerization and orchestration tools (Docker and Kubernetes), and cloud platforms (AWS or Google Cloud).

Despite the candidate's strong educational background and some relevant skills, the lack of experience in the required field and insufficient proficiency in specific technologies make them an unlikely fit for this position."

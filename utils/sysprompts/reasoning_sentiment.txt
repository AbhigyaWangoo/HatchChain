task is to identify whether the input seeks to accept or reject the candidate. Return 'True' if the input accepts the candidate, and 'False'
if the input is trying to reject the candidate. 

You must only return 'True' or 'False' and nothing else

Q: or jacob kim, i would reject for the backend engineer position. the main reasons are:

- only has 2 years of experience, less than the required minimum of 3 years.  
- no professional experience explicitly working on backend systems or infrastructure. roles are mostly full-stack or front-end focused.
- lacks most of the preferred skills like python, go, spring boot, sql/nosql databases, message queues, docker/kubernetes.

while jacob shows potential, he does not yet have the specialized background or years of experience to successfully fulfill this backend-focused role. i would encourage him to gain more backend-specific skills and reapply in future.
A: False

Q: based on the information provided, i do not have enough details to make a definitive recommendation on whether to accept or reject prasoon shakya for the frontend engineer role. here is my assessment:

positives:
- strong skills in relevant technologies like react, javascript, html/css which are required for the role
- experience in frontend development and delivering positive impacts like improved performance and accessibility
- education matches qualifications 

negatives: 
- only 1 year of experience, while the role calls for minimum 3 years
- no details provided on expertise with specific requirements like next.js, typescript and prisma

given the limited information, i cannot make a solid yes/no decision. i would request more details on prasoon's experience with next.js, typescript and prisma before deciding. his core frontend development skills seem aligned, but confirming his proficiency in the specific technologies listed would help determine if he clears the bar set for this position. more data is needed to make the right hire/no-hire call.
A: False

Q: based on the information provided, i do not have enough details to make a definitive recommendation on whether to accept or reject caitlyn for the software engineer position. however, here is an assessment of how her background aligns with some of the key requirements:

positives:
- strong academic credentials with a bs in computer science from uc berkeley and high gpas
- some relevant skills listed like python, django, react native which match the job description 
- internship experience at reputable tech companies like facebook, google, etc.

potential gaps:
- only 4 years of experience based on the years of experience provided, while the role asks for minimum 3 years specifically as a backend engineer
- no clear backend engineering roles listed - mostly titled as software engineer or software developer
- lacks explicit mentions of some of the core backend technologies like java, spring boot, sql/nosql databases, kafka etc. highlighted in the job description

given there are some potential gaps around her backend engineering experience and proficiency in certain technologies, i would recommend following up with a few clarifying questions:

1. confirm if she has worked specifically as a backend engineer for 3+ years. if not, validate if her software engineering roles involved deep backend systems work.

2. ask for examples of her hands-on experience with java, spring boot, sql/nosql databases, message queues like kafka that are required for this position. 

3. inquire about any backend-focused projects, apis/microservices she has designed and delivered.

4. assess knowledge of security protocols, performance optimization, debugging production issues based on her prior experience.

based on her responses and if she is able to convincingly address these areas around back-end development proficiency, then she could likely be a good fit. else, may be challenging for her to ramp up on some of the core backend technologies expected for this role. so i would recommend seeking more clarification before making a final determination.
A: False
